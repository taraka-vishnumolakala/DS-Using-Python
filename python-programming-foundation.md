# Python Programming Foundation

## Python Basics

- Compiler Vs Interpreter 
  - Compiler takes the whole chunk of code and converts it to binary or low level language that the machine can understand  and then executes it. 
  - Interpreter on the other hand converts the code line by line and executes it.
- How are python programs executed ?
  - Write code and save it as a `.py` file --> Compile and convert it platform independent intermediate byte code --> Interpreter now reads the intermediate binary code line by line and executes it.
- Python doesn't have any primitive types unlike java or c++. Any variable declared in python creates an object behind the scenes.
